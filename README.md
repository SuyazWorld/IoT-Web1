<h1 align="center">V1.0.0</h1> 


### Simple IoT site to control LED and Servo. This site can also monitor changes in ultrasonic sensor data and potentiometers in real-time. But this is still very simple, does not contain tables, charts, Databases. This IoT Web only consists of one page, but is very suitable for fast and simple use such as for on/off widgets, wireless potentio, and many more
